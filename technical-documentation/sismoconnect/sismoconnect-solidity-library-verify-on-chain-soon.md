# sismoConnect Solidity Library: Verify On-chain

The [sismoConnect](../../what-is-sismo/sismoconnect.md) Solidity Library is built on top of the [Hydra-S2 Verifier](https://github.com/sismo-core/hydra-s2-zkps) and allows to easily verify proofs from your users **on-chain**. You can see a full guide on how to integrate sismoConnect into your application [here](../../tutorials/sismoconnect/gate-your-contracts-with-sismoconnect-advanced.md).

This page will detail all the specifications of the sismoConnect Solidity Library.

You can find the Solidity Lib GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/sismo-core/sismo-connect-packages/tree/main/packages/sismo-connect-solidity).

## Usage

Import the SismoConnect lib to your contract:

```solidity
import "sismo-connect-solidity/libs/sismo-connect/SismoConnectLib.sol";
```

Then:

* **Inherit** your contract from the sismoConnect Library
* **Call** the SismoConnect constructor in the constructor of your contract
* **Create** the request objects:
  * Create a [Claim](./#claim) OR an [Auth](./#auth) object in the constructor.
  *   Create a [signedMessage](./#signedmessage):&#x20;

      * By hardcoding a signedMessage in your contract, you can ensure that the sismoConnectResponse have the same signed message that the one you hardcoded.

      > **Example 1**: Define a specific message (like the one used fo Sign-in with Ethereum), so the lib can verify the user use the same message to generate the proof.

      * You can also define it by passing it as argument of a function of your contract. And verify it regarding the sismoConnectResponse one.

      > **Example 2**: A user need to specify an address to receive an airdrop. He will send his address as parameter of the contract function, so the lib can verify that is the same address that the one used to generate the proof.

This will then allow you to check if the proof the user wants to check corresponds to the proof expected by the contract.

```solidity
import "sismo-connect-solidity/libs/sismo-connect/SismoConnectLib.sol";

contract MyContract is SismoConnect { // inherits from sismoConnect library
 // the Claim request object we want to verify the SismoConnectResponse with
 Claim claimRequest;
 
 // you can also have an Auth request
 //Auth authRequest;
 
 // Or a signedMessage request
 // bytes signedMessageRequest;
 
 // call SismoConnect constructor with your appId
 constructor(bytes16 appId, bytes16 groupId) SismoConnect(appId) {
  // creation of the claim request with a groupId
  claimRequest = buildClaim({groupId: groupId});
  
  // you can also pass in arguments other objects in order to create
  // an AuthRequest
  // authRequest = buildAuth({authRequest: authRequest});

  // Or a signedMessage request
  // signedMessageRequest = "yes"
}
...
}
```

Finally, use the `verify()` function to verify the proof stored in `sismoConnectResponse` with respect to the requests you built. For example, here we verify that the proof in the `sismoConnectResponse` is cryptographically valid for the `groupId` previously chosen in the constructor.

```solidity
function doSomethingUsingSismoConnect(bytes memory sismoConnectResponse) public {
    // store the result of the verification
    SismoConnectVerifiedResult memory sismoConnectVerifiedResult = 
    // verify the proof with respect to the claim request
    verify(sismoConnectResponse, claimRequest);
    
    // You can also pass the signedMessage as argument here (see Example 2)
    // verify(sismoConnectResponse, claimRequest, _signedMessage);
}
```

If your proof is valid, the contract will continue its execution, otherwise it will reject an error.

## Documentation

## `verify()`

The `verify()` function allows you to verify a proof generated by the [Sismo Vault app](../../what-is-sismo/data-vault.md) with respect to some requests.

```solidity
function verify(
    bytes memory responseBytes, // required
    Auth memory authRequest, // optional
    Claim memory claimRequest, // optional
    bytes memory messageSignatureRequest, // optional
    bytes16 namespace // optional
) public returns (SismoConnectVerifiedResult memory)
```

The function can take these 5 arguments:

* `responseBytes` _(required)_: The response sent back by the [Data Vault](../data-vault-app.md). It contains the [appId](./#appid), the [namespace](./#namespace), the [version](./#version) and the proof corresponding to the [Data requests](./#data-requests).

The function needs to verify that the proof is cryptographically valid but also that it has been well generated from the Data request specified in the frontend. To do this, we also need to setup the same requests in the contract:

* ``[`claimRequest`](./#claim): The object that holds all the information needed to generate proof of group ownership.
* ``[`authRequest`](./#auth): The object that holds all the information needed to generate proof of account membership.
* ``[`messageSignatureRequest`](./#signedmessage):  It contains the message that the user should sign.
* ``[`namespace`](./#namespace): The namespace of the application that the contract uses.

And it returns a [`SismoConnectVerifiedResult`](sismoconnect-solidity-library-verify-on-chain-soon.md#sismoconnectverifiedresult).

### `responseBytes` _(required)_

The `responseBytes` is the encoded version of the `sismoConnectResponse`, the response that the frontend received from the Data Vault App.

Once decoded here is the type of the `sismoConnectResponse`:

```solidity
struct SismoConnectResponse {
    // the app identifier (registered in the Sismo Factory)
    bytes16 appId; 
    // the app service from which the proof is requested
    // default: bytes16(keccak256("main"))
    bytes16 namespace; 
    // the version of the Data Vault app
    // default: "sismo-connect-v2"
    bytes32 version; 
    // the array of sismoConnect proofs generated
    // only one proof is generated for now)
    SismoConnectProof[] proofs;
}
```

**``**[**`appId`**](./#appid) : The unique identifier of your application registered on the Sismo Factory app.

**``**[**`namespace`**](./#namespace) : By default set to “main”. You can optionally define a `namespace` on top of the `appId` to use the sismoConnect flow in different parts of your application.

**``**[**`version`**](./#version) : The version of the Data Vault app queried. The only version that work is now `sismo-connect-v2`.

**`proofs[]`** : The array that contains all the sismoConnectProofs the frontend provide to the contract. Learn more about proofs [**here**](./#proofs). **NB**: for now, only 1 proof can be generated.\
A sismoConnectProof stores several objects:

```solidity
struct SismoConnectProof {
  Claim claim;
  Auth auth;
  bytes signedMessage;
  bytes32 provingScheme;
  bytes proofData;
  bytes extraData;
}
```

**``**[**`claim`**](./#claim) : The data requested to generate a group membership proof for a specific value.

* ``[`groupId`](./#groupid) : The unique identifier of the group of accounts to which the user must prove that he belongs to in order to generate the proof.
* ``[`groupTimeStamp`](./#grouptimestamp) : By default, the timestamp of the latest Group Snapshot. Groups are composed of snapshots generated either once, daily, or weekly. Each Group Snapshot generated has a timestamp associated to it.
* `value`: In a group, each account is associated with a value. Querying a specific `value` restricts eligibility to users belonging to the group with `value` that respect the `claimType` defined.
* `claimType` : Allow choosing if we want to restrict the eligibility for the accounts that have the exact (`EQ`), at least (`GTE`) (or other type of comparison) the `value` specified before. Comparators accepted: `EMPTY`, `GTE`, `GT`, `EQ`, `LT`, `LTE`, `USER_SELECT`.
* `extraData`: other data that can be used in the future by other proving scheme. Currently not used in the current proving scheme use: the [Hydra-S2](../../technical-concepts/proving-schemes/hydra-s2.md).

**``**[**`auth`**](./#auth) : The data requested to generate a proof of account ownership

* `authType` : The type of the account you want to authenticate through the vault. Types accepted: `EMPTY`, `ANON`, `GITHUB`, `TWITTER`, `EVM_ACCOUNT`
* `anonMode` : if anonMode = true (**soon™**), the user does not reveal the Id of his account, so he only proves the ownership of one account of the type `authType` in the vault. For now only anonMode = false works.
* `userId` : the userId depends on the authType you specified. For instance, if the authType is TWITTER, the userId will be your twitterId. \
  Note: If the authType is ANON, the userId is the vaultId. You can find more info on the vaultId [**here**](../../technical-concepts/vault-and-proof-identifiers.md#vault-identifier).
* `extraData` : other data that can be used in the future by other proving scheme. Currently not used in the current proving scheme use: the [Hydra-S2](../../technical-concepts/proving-schemes/hydra-s2.md).

**`signedMessage`** : A message provided by the user and signed with the vault.

**`provingScheme`** : The proving scheme that the [Data Vault app](../data-vault-app.md) used to generate the proof and by the verify to verify the proof.

**`proofData`** : The proof content.

**`extraData`** : other data that can be used in the future by other proving scheme. Currently not used in the current proving scheme use: the [Hydra-S2](../../technical-concepts/proving-schemes/hydra-s2.md).



The next objects are the references that allow the `verify()` function to ensure that the proof sent by the user matches to the proof expected by the contract:

### ``[`claimRequest`](./#claim) _(optional)_

The data requested to generate a group membership proof for a specific value.

```solidity
struct Claim {
  bytes16 groupId; // required
  bytes16 groupTimestamp; // optional
  uint256 value; // optional
  ClaimType claimType; // optional
  bytes extraData; // optional
}

enum ClaimType {
  EMPTY,
  GTE,
  GT,
  EQ,
  LT,
  LTE,
  USER_SELECT
}

// Example: Build your Sismo Contributor level 2 claim
Claim memory myExampleClaim = buildClaim({
    groupId: 0xe9ed316946d3d98dfcd829a53ec9822e,
    value 2
})
```

### ``[`authRequest`](./#auth) _(optional)_

The data requested to generate a proof of account ownership.

```solidity
struct Auth {
    AuthType authType; // required
    bool anonMode; // optional
    uint256 userId; // optional
    bytes extraData; //optional
}

enum AuthType {
  EMPTY,
  ANON,
  GITHUB,
  TWITTER,
  EVM_ACCOUNT
}

// Example: Build your Twitter auth
Auth memory myExampleAuth = buildAuth({
    authType: authType.TWITTER
})
```

### ``[`messageSignatureRequest`](./#signedmessage) _(optional)_

A message provided by the user and signed with the Vault.

```solidity
// Example of a signedMessage
bytes memory signedMessage = "yes"
```

### ``[`namespace`](./#namespace) _(optional)_

By default set to “main”. You can optionally define a `namespace` on top of the `appId` to use the sismoConnect flow in different parts of your application. You can see an example of two different namespaces used at the end of the [sismoConnect server documentation](sismoconnect-server-verify-off-chain.md).



### SismoConnectVerifiedResult

The `sismoConnectVerifiedResult` is the object returned by the `verify()` function if the proof verification passed. It contains all the verifications processed, that is:

* The claim: `verifiedClaims`
* The auth: `verifiedAuths`
* The signed message `signedMessages`

```solidity
struct SismoConnectVerifiedResult {
    bytes16 appId;
    bytes16 namespace;
    bytes32 version;
    VerifiedClaim[] verifiedClaims;
    VerifiedAuth[] verifiedAuths;
    bytes[] signedMessages;
}
```

As said previously, for now we can only generate 1 sismoConnectProof, that can contain a claim, an auth and a signedMessage. Thats is why, only the first element of the three array (verifiedClaims, verifiedAuths, signedMessages) can be used.
