# What Is Sismo Connect?

Sismo Connect, a crypto-native single sign-on (SSO), enables applications to request any data aggregated in a users' Data Vaults.

Onchain and offchain applications can request users to prove ownership of Data Sources (Ethereum, Twitter, Telegram and GitHub accounts) and make anonymous claims about them (e.g. that they own a certain NFT, contributed to a GitHub repository or voted in a DAO).&#x20;

Sismo Connect allows developers to implement Zero-Knowledge proofs in their applications with only a few lines of code.

## Apps can access powerful data at once

Applications can request users to:

**Authenticate:** Request and verify proof of Data Source ownerships.

* Ethereum wallets
* GitHub, Twitter or Telegram accounts

**Selective disclose data:** Request and verify claims about their Data Sources.

* Member of the "[Stand with Crypto](https://nft.coinbase.com/collection/ethereum/0x9d90669665607f08005cae4a7098143f554c59ef)" NFT Minters [Group](https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=0xfae674b6cba3ff2f8ce2114defb200b1), with value > 10 (= minted more than 10 NFTs)
* Member of the Contributors to [Sismo Hub](https://github.com/sismo-core/sismo-hub) GitHub repo  [Group](https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=0xda1c3726426d5639f4c6352c2c976b87), with value > 3 (= made more than 3 contributions to the repo)
* Member of the [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/welcome) holders [Group](https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=0x1cde61966decb8600dfd0749bd371f12), with value > 15 (= Sybil-resistance score higher than 15)
* Member of the [ENS DAO](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/) Voters [Group](https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=0x85c7ee90829de70d0d51f52336ea4722), with value > 3 (= more than 3 times)
* Member of Sismo Community[ Group](https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=0xd630aa769278cacde879c5c0fe5d203c), with value exactly = 3 (= community member level 3)

**Signatures**: Your app can securely obtain user-signed messages, enabling front-running protection for instance.

## Case Studies

The case studies below showcase the power of Sismo Connect, demonstrating how it can benefit users and applications through concrete examples.

### SafeDrop: Sybil-Resistant Airdrop from Privately Aggregated Data

SafeDrop is a Sybil-resistant and privacy-preserving ERC20 airdrop that distributes AIR tokens to users proportionally based on their reputation, aggregated from diverse sources of data (EVM wallets, Telegram, Twitter and GitHub accounts).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/SafeDrop_Case Study (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By integrating Sismo Connect, SafeDrop users can generate a ZK proof to establish they own accounts making them eligible for the airdrop. No connection between these accounts and the airdrop destination address is ever made.

### Sybil-resistant and anonymous Lottery

Sismo built a "Privacy Is Normal" anon lottery. Only Tornado Cash users that have prove some proof of personhood via Gitcoin Passport can enter the lottery to win a printed tribute to the protocolâ€™s revolutionary code or its NFT equivalent.

By integrating Sismo Connect, Privacy Is Normal enables users to generate a ZK proof establishing they own a Tornado Cash depositing address without directly revealing it. In addition, users prove ownership of a Gitcoin Passport to add an effective layer of Sybil resistance, allowing only those users with adequate scores to participate.
