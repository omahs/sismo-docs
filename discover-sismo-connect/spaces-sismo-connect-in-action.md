# Spaces: Sismo Connect in Action

Welcome to an in-depth exploration of [Sismo Connect](../#sismo-connect-the-crypto-native-sso), a crypto-native single sign-on (SSO) solution that integrates with onchain and offchain applications—leveraging data derived from web2 and web3. This article showcases concrete, real-world examples of applications utilizing Sismo Connect to authenticate users and request private and granular data, empowering them to selectively disclose their personal information.

## Discover Sismo Connect Apps on Spaces

Visit [Sismo Spaces](https://spaces.sismo.io/) to explore applications that harness the power of Sismo Connect. Spaces provide community builders with a portal to showcase Sismo Connect applications.

Currently, only The Merge Contributors Space is available. For now, try out this [demo](https://demo.spaces.sismo.io/sismo).
{% endhint %}

Connecting to a Space creates a unique profile for users to browse Sismo Connect applications via a [Vault ID](../knowledge-base/resources/technical-concepts/vault-and-proof-identifiers.md)—an anonymous identifier that indicates a unique user on a specific app. When connecting to a Space, users authenticate ownership of a Data Vault and may share additional Data Sources.

## The Merge Contributors

The Merge Contributors is a Space that contains applications for contributors to The Merge on Ethereum. The Space contains the following applications:

* **zkDrop** — an onchain application that enables secure, privacy-focused airdrops through Sismo Connect. Users verify ownership of an account in the \[the-merge-contributor] Data Group and obtain the airdrop in a different account, ensuring that no connection is established between the two accounts.
* **zkSub** — an offchain application enabling owners of accounts in the \[the-merge-contributor] Data Group to privately register email addresses for exclusive web3 event tickets. Sismo Connect acts as a ZK layer between emails and accounts.
