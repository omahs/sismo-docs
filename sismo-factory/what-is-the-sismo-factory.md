# What is the Sismo Factory?

The Sismo Factory is a no-code user interface designed to allow anyone to start building with Sismo and use its open-source infrastructure. It is designed for users of all experience levels, allowing anyone to deploy the infrastructure necessary to harness the capabilities of Sismo's communication protocolâ€”no developer experience required.

On the Sismo Factory, users can create Data Groups, Sismo Connect Apps, and ZK Badges. In addition, users can learn how to contribute to the Factory by creating  Data Providers.

### In This Section

In the proceeding pages of this documentation, you will find guides designed to help you navigate and master the Sismo Factory. Here is an overview of what to expect:

* [**Create a Data Group**](create-your-group.md)**:** This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Data Group in the Sismo Factory. Data Groups are collections of users with similar personal data and enable users to bring elements of their identity to applications via Sismo Connect.&#x20;
* [**Create a Sismo Connect App**](create-a-sismo-connect-app.md)**:** To integrate Sismo Connect into an application, developers first need a unique appId. Learn how to create an appId on the Sismo Factory in this step-by-step guide.
* [**Create a ZK Badge**](create-your-zk-badge.md)**:** ZK Badges are non-transferable tokens (SBTs) that represent verified facts about a user's personal data. This guide will demonstrate how to create a ZK Badge within the Sismo Factory.

Each section is designed to equip you with the knowledge and confidence to use the Sismo Factory effectively. Whether you're a newcomer to Sismo or an experienced user looking to deepen your understanding, these guides will provide insights and instructions to help you start building on the Sismo Factory.&#x20;

[Data Providers](../knowledge-base/resources/sismo-hub/data-providers.md) contribute to the Sismo Factory by allowing Data Groups to be frequently updated via automated data fetching.
