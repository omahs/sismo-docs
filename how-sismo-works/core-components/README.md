# Core Components

Sismo enables communication between a user’s personal data and applications. The following components are fundamental in facilitating this communication:

* [Data Vault](what-is-the-data-vault.md) — a local, sovereign and private identity aggregator
* [Data Sources](../../data-groups/data-groups-and-how-to-create-them/#data-sources) — web2 or web3 accounts and other credentials aggregated in a user’s Data Vault
* [Data Groups](../../data-groups/data-groups-and-how-to-create-them/#data-groups) — enable users to make claims about their Data Sources.
* [Proving schemes](proving-schemes/) — cryptographic circuits that enable users to prove ownership of Data Sources and group membership of Data Sources
* [The Sismo Hub](./#what-is-the-sismo-hub) — Sismo’s data infrastructure used to create Data Groups, thus enabling users to make claims of group membership.

Sismo enables users to freely leverage Data Sources, bypassing the typical privacy limitations associated with web3 and the constraint of being confined to a single platform on web2.
