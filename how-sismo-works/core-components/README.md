# Core Components

Sismo enables communication between a user’s personal data and applications. The following components are fundamental in facilitating this communication:

* [Data Vault](what-is-the-data-vault.md) — a local, sovereign and private identity aggregator that stores [Data Sources](../../data-groups/data-groups-and-creation/#data-sources)
* [Proving schemes](proving-schemes/) — cryptographic circuits that enable users to prove ownership of Data Sources and membership in [Data Groups](../../data-groups/data-groups-and-creation/#data-groups)
* [The Sismo Hub](what-is-the-data-vault-1.md#what-is-the-sismo-hub) — Sismo’s data infrastructure used to create Data Groups, thus enabling users to make claims about their personal data.

Sismo enables users to freely leverage Data Sources, bypassing the typical privacy limitations associated with web3 and the constraint of being confined to a single platform on web2.
