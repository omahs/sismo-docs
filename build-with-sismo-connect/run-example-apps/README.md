# Run Example Apps

This section is all about giving you a taste of the Sismo Connect integration experience. We'll guide you through running local applications integrated with Sismo Connect, so you can experiment with it and see it in action.

We've got two example projects ready for you to explore:

1. The **onchain** sample project — where you can learn the process of claiming gated airdrops.
2. The **offchain** sample project — where you can learn how to register a user in a database while ensuring their privacy.
