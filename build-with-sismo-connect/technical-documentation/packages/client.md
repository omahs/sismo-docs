# Sismo Connect Client: Request

The [Sismo Connect](broken-reference) Client is a front-end package built on top of the [Data Vault](../../../#data-vault-aggregate-your-identity) app (the prover) to easily request proofs from your users with [AuthRequests](../auths.md), [ClaimRequests](../claims.md) and [SignatureRequests](../signature.md).

## Installation

Install the Sismo Connect Client package in your front end with `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# with npm
npm install @sismo-core/sismo-connect-client
# with yarn
yarn add @sismo-core/sismo-connect-client
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Make sure to have at least v18.15.0 as Node version. You can encounter issues with ethers dependencies if not.
{% endhint %}

## Example Usage

Here is an example of a customized usage of the request function:

You want to create an NFT airdrop for **holders of a Nouns DAO NFT** owning a **Gitcoin Passport** and a **Twitter account**.

So you want your users to prove that they own a **Nouns DAO NFT**. In order to make your airdrop more Sybil-resistant, you will require them to also prove a **Gitcoin Passport ownership with a passport value greater or equal to 15** and a **Twitter account ownership**.

These proofs should be made for the service named **"sismo-edition".** When the proofs are generated, you want your users to be redirected to the claim page of your website at the path **"https://my-nft-drop.xyz/sismo-edition/claim-nft"**.

You will then use these proofs to airdrop an NFT if they are valid.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">import { 
  AuthRequest, 
  AuthType, 
  ClaimRequest, 
  ClaimType,
  SismoConnect,
  SismoConnectConfig
} from "@sismo-core/sismo-connect-client";

const config: SismoConnectConfig = {
  // you will need to get an appId from the Factory
  appId: "0xf4977993e52606cfd67b7a1cde717069", 
}

const sismoConnect = SismoConnect({
  config
})

// auth request for a proof of Twitter account ownership
const twitterRequest: AuthRequest = { 
    authType: AuthType.TWITTER,
};

// claim request for a proof of "Nouns DAO Nft holders" group membership
const nounsDaoRequest: ClaimRequest = { 
    // id of the group nouns-dao-nft-holders
    // https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=nouns-dao-nft-holders
    groupId: "0x311ece950f9ec55757eb95f3182ae5e2",
};

// claim request for a proof of "Gitcoin Passport holders" group membership
const gitcoinPassportRequest: ClaimRequest = { 
    // id of the group gitcoin-passport-holders
    // https://factory.sismo.io/groups-explorer?search=gitcoin-passport-holders
    groupId: "0x1cde61966decb8600dfd0749bd371f12",
    // users should have at least 15 as value in the group to claim the airdrop
    value: 15,
    claimType: GTE
};

// redirect users to the Vault App to generate proofs based on the requirements
// expressed in the auth and claim requests
sismoConnect.request({
<strong>    auth: twitterRequest,
</strong>    claims: [nounsDaoRequest, gitcoinPassportRequest],
    namespace: "sismo-edition",
    callbackUrl: "https://my-nft-drop.xyz/sismo-edition/claim-nft"
})
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
A namespace is useful when you want your users to generate proofs for different services in an app. You can see more information about how to use it in the [Sismo Connect Server package documentation](server.md).
{% endhint %}

### `getResponse()`

```typescript
function getResponse(): SismoConnectResponse | null
```

The `getResponse` function returns the [`SismoConnectResponse`](client.md#sismoconnectresponse) object containing the proofs generated by your user after coming back from the Data Vault app. Proofs can be sent to your back end and verified thanks to the [`@sismo-core/sismo-connect-server`](https://github.com/sismo-core/sismo-connect-packages/tree/main/packages/sismo-connect-server) package OR sent to your contract that uses the [Sismo Connect Solidity library](solidity.md) to verify.

#### `getResponseBytes()`

```typescript
function getResponseBytes(): string | null
```

The `getResponseBytes` function returns the response encoded in bytes usable by the [`@sismo-core/sismo-connect-solidity`](https://github.com/sismo-core/sismo-connect-solidity) Library.

#### `SismoConnectResponse`

```typescript
type SismoConnectResponse = {
    // the appId registered in the Factory
    appId: string;
    // Sismo Connect version
    version: string;
    // service from which the proof is requested
    namespace?: string;
    signedMessage?: string;
    proofs: SismoConnectProof[]
}

type SismoConnectProof = {
    auths?: Auth[];
    claims?: Claim[];
    provingScheme: string;
    proofData: string;
    extraData: any;
}
```
