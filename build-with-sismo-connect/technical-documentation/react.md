# Sismo Connect React: Request

The [Sismo Connect](../../discover-sismo-connect/empower-your-app.md) React package is a wrapper of the Sismo Connect client package which is a package build on top of the [Sismo Data Vault](../../what-is-sismo/personal-data-sismos-data-vault-gems-and-groups.md) app (the prover) to easily request proofs from your users.

### Installation

Install the Sismo Connect React package in your frontend with `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# with npm
npm install @sismo-core/sismo-connect-react
# with yarn
yarn add @sismo-core/sismo-connect-react
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Make sure to have at least v18.15.0 as Node version. You can encounter issues with ethers dependencies if not.
{% endhint %}

## Usage

To integrate Sismo Connect into your front end, you can use the Sismo Connect button. Clicking on this button will redirect your user to the Sismo Data Vault app, where they can generate their proof.

After your user generates the proof, they will be automatically redirected back to your app with a response containing the generated proof.

To integrate it you have access through the package to the `SismoConnectButton` component.

```typescript
import { SismoConnectButton, AuthType, SismoConnectClientConfig, SismoConnectResponse } from "@sismo-core/sismo-connect-react";

export const sismoConnectConfig: SismoConnectClientConfig = {
  appId: "0x8f347ca31790557391cec39b06f02dc2",
};

<SismoConnectButton 
    //You will need to register an appId in the Factory
    appId={"0x8f347ca31790557391cec39b06f02dc2"}
    
    //Request proofs from your users for a groupId
    claim={{
        groupId: "0x42c768bb8ae79e4c5c05d3b51a4ec74a"
    }}
    //OR
    claims={[{
        groupId: "0x42c768bb8ae79e4c5c05d3b51a4ec74a"
    }]}
    
    auth={{
        authType: AuthType.VAULT
    }}
    //OR
    auths={[{
        authType: AuthType.VAULT
    }]}
    
    signature={{
        message: "Your message"
    }}
    //After user redirection get a response containing his proofs 
    onResponse={async (response: SismoConnectResponse) => {
	//Send the response to your server to verify it
	//thanks to the @sismo-core/sismo-connect-server package
    }}
    onResponseBytes={async (bytes: string) => {
        //Send the response to your contract to verify it
        //thanks to the @sismo-core/sismo-connect-solidity package
    }}
/>
```

After a user generates the proof, he will be automatically redirected back to the app. The `onResponse` and `onResponseBytes` props will allow you to get the response containing the proof.

To get the response of your user after his redirection without using the `SismoConnectButton` you can also use the `useSismoConnect` hook. This allows you to redirect your user to a page other than the page with the button integrated.

```typescript
import { useSismoConnect, SismoConnectClientConfig } from "@sismo-core/sismo-connect-react";

const config: SismoConnectClientConfig = { appId: "0x8f347ca31790557391cec39b06f02dc2" };

const { response, responseBytes } = useSismoConnect({ config });
```

The `useSismoConnect` hook also exposes the Sismo Connect variable which provides access to all the features available in the Sismo Connect Client package.

```typescript
const { sismoConnect } = useSismoConnect({ config });
```

Please see the [Sismo Connect Client documentation](client.md) to see all the possibilities around the Sismo Connect instance.

### Documentation

This package is a wrapper of the Sismo Connect Client package, which means that all the core concepts such as config, claimRequest, authRequest, messageSignatureRequest, and response are the same as in the client package. If you need to explore these concepts in detail, we advise you to refer to the [Sismo Connect Client](client.md) page, which provides more detailed information.

#### SismoConnectButton

The SismoConnectButton component will allow you to easily request proofs from your user for a groupId he should be a member of.

```typescript
import { AuthType, SismoConnectButton, SismoConnectClientConfig, SismoConnectResponse } from "@sismo-core/sismo-connect-react";

const config: SismoConnectClientConfig = {
    appId: "0x8f347ca31790557391cec39b06f02dc2", 
    devMode: {
    	// will use the Dev Sismo Data Vault https://dev.vault-beta.sismo.io/
    	enabled: true, 
    	// overrides a group with these addresses
    	devGroups: [{
      		groupId: "0x42c768bb8ae79e4c5c05d3b51a4ec74a",
      		data: {
        		"0x123...abc": 1, 
        		"0x456...efa": 2
      		}
  	}]
    }
};
 
<SismoConnectButton 
    //Request proofs for this groupId
    claim={{
        groupId: "0x42c768bb8ae79e4c5c05d3b51a4ec74a"
    }}
    //OR 
    claims={[{
        groupId: "0x42c768bb8ae79e4c5c05d3b51a4ec74a"
    }]}
    
    auth={{
        authType: AuthType.VAULT
    }}
    //OR 
    auths={[{
        authType: AuthType.VAULT
    }]}
    
    signature={{
        message: "Your message"
    }}
    config={config}
    onResponse={async (response: SismoConnectResponse) => {
	//Send the response to your server to verify it
	//thanks to the @sismo-core/sismo-connect-server package
    }}
    onResponseBytes={async (bytes: string) => {
        //Send the response to your contract to verify it
        //thanks to the @sismo-core/sismo-connect-solidity package
    }}
/>
```

**Customization**

If you want to customize the style of your button you can use 3 CSS classes `SismoConnectButton`, `sismoConnectButtonText`, and `sismoConnectButtonLogo`.

An overrideStyle prop is also available on the component which allows you to override the same style as the class `sismoConnectButton`.

Here is an example of a custom button:

```css
//Added in the index.css of a React app

.sismoConnectButton {
	background: red !important;
}
.sismoConnectButtonText {
	color: blue !important;
}
.sismoConnectButtonLogo {
	display: none
}
```

#### useSismoConnect

The `useSismoConnect` hook makes it easy for you to obtain the response containing the user proof, and it provides access to all functions exposed by the Sismo Connect client instance.

```typescript
import { useSismoConnect } from "@sismo-core/sismo-connect-react";

const { useSismoConnect, response, responseBytes } = useSismoConnect({ config });
```
